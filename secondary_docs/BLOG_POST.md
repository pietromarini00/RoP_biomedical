## What Is RoP?

**RoP is 1.33 million harmonized biomedical Common Data Elements with semantic embeddings, value sets, and governance parameters that make multi-cohort research actually interoperable.**

RoP is the foundation for **The Forge** — our automated data and schema harmonization registry with human-in-the-loop validation. Think of RoP as fuel for the harmonization engine.

Right now, multi-cohort studies spend months (often years) manually mapping variables—PPMI calls it "MoCA Total Score," NACC calls it `MOCATOTS`, ADNI calls it `MOCA`. Same assessment, zero automatic compatibility. Multiply this by 500 variables across 10 cohorts, and you're looking at **person-years of manual mapping** before analysis even starts.

**The cost:** Biomedical researchers spend 40-70% of their time on data wrangling and harmonization (Kaggle survey). RoP + The Forge save an order of magnitude in both time and cost for data standardization.

**RoP provides 1.33 million pre-harmonized Common Data Elements (CDEs)** organized into **13 themes** covering every layer of biomedical data—from individual identity and clinical phenotypes to genomics, imaging, governance, and resource catalogs. Built on OMOP, LOINC, ICD-10, HPO, Mondo, and 9 other major vocabularies.

**This isn't aspirational. It's running in production** across hundreds of thousands of samples and multiple millions of data points for collaborators leading massive federated open science initiatives.

## Why It Matters

**We want to accelerate the biomedical research community. Let's make research as FAIR as possible.**

Multi-cohort research shouldn't require 6 months of manual variable mapping before the first analysis. RoP solves this by providing a shared reference that enables:

- **Interoperability:** Tag your variable with a RoP ID once → instant compatibility across federated studies
- **AI-readiness:** Semantic embeddings enable AI-assisted harmonization (10x faster than manual)
- **FAIR principles:** Findable (DOI-versioned), Accessible (open download), Interoperable (cross-vocab mappings), Reusable (full reproducibility)

**The work behind RoP:** Weeks of planning, one weekend of compute, decades of experience. The v2026.04 release represents 6+ person-years of expert harmonization work, distilled into a 7.8 GB download.

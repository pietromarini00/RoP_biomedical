# LinkedIn Post: RoP v2026.04 Release

---

**We're releasing RoP v2026.04 — 1.33 million harmonized biomedical Common Data Elements — openly for the research community.**

## What & Why

**RoP is 1.33 million harmonized biomedical Common Data Elements with semantic embeddings, value sets, and governance parameters that make multi-cohort research actually interoperable.**

RoP is the foundation for **The Forge** — our automated data and schema harmonization registry with human-in-the-loop validation. Think of RoP as fuel for the harmonization engine.

Right now, multi-cohort studies spend months manually mapping variables. PPMI calls it "MoCA Total Score," NACC calls it `MOCATOTS`, ADNI calls it `MOCA`. Same assessment, zero automatic compatibility.

**The cost:** Biomedical researchers spend 40-70% of their time on data wrangling and harmonization (Kaggle survey). RoP + The Forge save an order of magnitude in both time and cost for data standardization.

**We want to accelerate the biomedical research community. Let's make research as FAIR as possible.**

RoP provides a shared reference covering every layer of biomedical data—from individual identity and clinical phenotypes to genomics, imaging, governance, and resource catalogs. Built on OMOP, LOINC, ICD-10, HPO, Mondo, and 9 other major vocabularies.

**This isn't aspirational. It's running in production** across hundreds of thousands of samples and multiple millions of data points for collaborators leading massive federated open science initiatives.
